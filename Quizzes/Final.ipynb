    "There are 9 questions, distributed over 4 parts (the last part is 3 questions). You must answer submit a written answer (via Canvas) for at least 6 questions, no later than 11:59 pm Saturday December 9th. This will account for 80% of your final exam grade, the remaining 20% of the final exam grade is based on the 20 min in-person exam (Friday December 8th). You will be asked two questions that will be taken from one of the questions below\n",

    "## Part 1. Function spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $s>0$, the Sobolev space $H^s$ is defined as $$ H^s:= \\{f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{C}  \\;\\mid\\; f \\text{ is 1-periodic and } \\|f\\|_{H^s}^2 := \\sum \\limits_k |c_k(f)|^2(1+|k|^{2s}) < \\infty\\}$$ let $S_N(f)$ be the $N$-partial Fourier sum for $f$, $$S_N(f) = \\sum \\limits_{k=-N}^N c_ke^{2\\pi ikx}$$ Show that if $s>2$ and $f\\in H^s$ then $$\\sup_N \\int_0^1 \\left |\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}S_N(f)\\right |^2\\;dx < \\infty.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Show that if $f:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{C}$ is such that $\\int_0^1|f'(x)|^2\\;dx <\\infty$ then $$|f(x)-f(y)|\\leq \\|f'\\|_{L^2}|x-y|^{1/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2. Ordinary differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fix $\\lambda>0$ and consider the following map $T:C[0,\\tau] \\to C[0,\\tau]$, $$T(x)(t) = \\int_0^t\\sin(\\lambda x(s))\\;ds$$ Find, as a function of $\\lambda$, the range of $\\tau$'s such that $T$ is a contraction mapping.\n",
    "2. Consider both the forward and backward Euler schemes for the basic 2D linear system $$\\dot x(t) =  \\left (\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}  \\right )  x(t)$$ For fixed $h>0$ let $\\hat x_n$ be the sequence generated by explicit Euler and $\\check x_n$ the one generated by implicit Euler. \n",
    "    1. There is a matrix $A=A_h$ and a matrix $B=B_h$ such that for every $n$ we have $\\hat x_{n+1} = A x_n$ and $\\check x_{n+1} = Bx_n$. Write down each of these matrices explicitly in terms of $h$. \n",
    "    2. For a fixed $h>0$ and a given initial condition $x_0$, determine what happens in the $n\\to \\infty$ limit to the sequence $\\check x_n$. \n",
    "    3. The analytical solution to the 2D linear system is always (save for the stationary solution which is always zero) a periodic function that never converges to zero. In light of this information and what you saw in parts i) and ii), discuss whether explicit Euler or implicit Euler is better tailored for approximating the solution for large times. \n",
    "    **Hint**: For part B), use the basic formula for the inverse of a $2\\times 2$ matrix to compute $B_h$, what can you observe about the resulting denominator?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3. Graphs, Laplacians, and Markov chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider a graph with vertices $G=\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_N\\}$ and symmetric weight matrix $w_{ij}$. A function $f:G\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is said to have a *strict* local maximum at a point $x_{i_0} \\in G$ if $f(x_{i_0})>f(x_j)$ for every $j$ such that $x_i$ and $x_j$ are neighbors. Show that if $f$ has a strict local maximum at $x_{i_0}$ then the graph Laplacian of $f$ at $x_{i_0}$ needs to be strictly negative.\n",
    "2. Fix $h>0$ and consider the graph $G = \\{x_1,\\ldots,x_N\\}$ given by the intersection of $h\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the unit square $[0,1]^2$, and where the weights $w_{ij}$ are defined to be $0$ if $x_i$, $x_j$ are not neighbors in $h\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $1/(4h^2)$ if they are neighbors. Compute the graph Laplacian of the function $f(x_i) := x_i \\cdot e$ where $e$ is some given vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4. Finite elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that if $A$ is a $N\\times N$ matrix, then $x$ solves the equation $$Ax =b$$ *if and only if* $$Ax \\cdot y = b\\cdot y \\text{ for all } y \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$$ What does this have to do with the finite element method?\n",
    "2. Consider $f(x,y)$, a twice differentiable function of two variables, and $\\bar v(x,y)$ the vector field $\\bar v(x,y) = (-y,x)$. Show that $f$ solves $$ \\Delta f + \\nabla f \\cdot \\bar v = 0$$ in the disc $D$ if and only if $$-\\int_D \\nabla f\\cdot \\nabla \\phi + f \\nabla \\phi \\cdot \\bar v \\;dxdy = 0 \\text{ for all } \\phi \\in C^2_c(D)$$\n",
    "3. The following illustrates FEM in the 1D case. Fix $N$. Denote by $\\mathcal{S}$ the subset of $C([0,1])$ of functions which are affine when restricted to every interval of the form $[k/N,(k+1)/N]$. Suppose that $u \\in \\mathcal{S}$ is such that $$-\\int_0^1 u'(x)\\phi'(x)\\;dx = 0 \\;\\forall\\;\\phi \\in \\mathcal{S}_0$$ where $\\mathcal{S}_0 := \\{ \\phi \\in \\mathcal{S} \\mid \\phi(0)=\\phi(1) = 0 \\}$ Then, show that for $k=1,\\ldots,N-1$ we have (with $x_k := k/N$) $$u(x_{k+1})+u(x_{k-1})-2u(x_k) = 0$$ that is, the function $u$ restricted to the points $x_k$ solves a graph Laplacian equation. **Hint**: See what happens if in the integral condition one takes as $\\phi$ the only element of $\\mathcal{S}$ which is zero at each $x_j$ with $j\\neq k$ and equal to $1$ at $x_k$."
