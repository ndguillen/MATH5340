    "1. Consider the forward Euler scheme for the differential equation $$\\dot x(t) = Ax(t)$$ where $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $A$ is a $d\\times d$ matrix, and the time step is $h>0$. Let $x_n$ be a sequence generated by the scheme, starting from some $x_0$. Prove that for every $n$ we have $$x_n = (I+hA)^nx_0$$ Then, assuming that $A$ is positive definite, show that for every fixed $h>0$ we have $\\|x_n\\|_2 \\to \\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$.  \n",
    "  Hint: Since $A$ is positive definite there is a basis of eigenvectors $e_1,\\ldots,e_d$ with $Ae_k = \\lambda_k e_k$ and $0<\\lambda_1\\leq \\lambda_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\lambda_d$, what happens if $x_0 = e_k$ for some $k$? What happens in general, expressing $x_0$ in this basis and multiplying by $(I+hA)$ $n$ consecutive times?\n",
    "2. Suppose that $f:\\mathbb{R}^d\\to\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant $L>0$ and $x_* \\in\\mathbb{R}^d$. Show for what values of $h$ we can guarantee the map $T:\\mathbb{R}^d\\to\\mathbb{R}^d$ given by $T(x) = x_* + hf(x)$ is a contraction mapping, and explain the relevance of this observation to the backward Euler scheme. \n",
    "3. The **trapezoidal rule** refers to a numerical scheme for $\\dot x(t) = f(x(t))$ where, for time step $h>0$ and initial condition $x_0$ the sequence $x_n$ is generated according to the implicit iterative relation $$x_{n+1}-x_n = \\frac{h}{2}(f(x_n)+f(x_{n+1}))$$ Show for what values of $h>$ can we guarantee that the map given by $T(x) = x_* + \\frac{h}{2}(f(x_*) +f(x))$ is a contraction mapping. Then, show that when $f(x) = Ax$ with $A$ a $d\\times d$ matrix, we have the relation $$ x_{n} = \\left [(I-\\frac{h}{2}A)^{-1}(I+\\frac{h}{2}A)\\right ]^nx_0  $$ provided $h$ is sufficiently small. Hint: You may use that $I-\\frac{h}{2}A$ is invertible if $h\\|A\\|<2$, where $\\|A\\| = \\max_{x \\neq 0} \\{\\|Ax\\|/\\|x\\|\\}$.\n",
    "4. The local truncation error for the trapezoidal rule applied to $\\dot x(t) = f(x(t))$ is defined by $$\\varepsilon_n^{(h)} = \\frac{1}{h}\\left [x(t_{n+1})-x(t_n) - \\frac{h}{2}(f(x(t_{n+1}))+f(x(t_n))) \\right ] $$ where $x(t)$ is the analytical solution to the differential equation and $t_n = nh$ ($h>0$ is the time step). Consider the 1d equation $\\dot x = -\\lambda x$, $\\lambda>0$, with initial data $x_0$ and for times $t>0$. Show that in this case $$|\\varepsilon_n^{(h)}| \\leq h^{-1}|x_0|\\left [ e^{-h\\lambda}-1 +\\frac{\\lambda h}{2}(e^{-h\\lambda}+1 )\\right ] $$ \n",
    "5. Show that the map $T:C([0,\\tau])\\to C([0,\\tau])$ defined by $$(Tx)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-x(s)}\\;ds$$ is a contraction mapping for every $\\tau \\in (0,1)$."
